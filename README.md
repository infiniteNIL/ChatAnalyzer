# ChatAnalyzer

Includes unit tests. To run just press cmd-U in Xcode to run all the unit tests.

The main target generates a command line program. You can run it from Xcode or from the command line. 

When running from Xcode you can change the argument (i.e. the chat message) in the ChatAnalyzer scheme's run arguments.

From the command line just pass your chat message as the first argument to the command wrapped in quotes. For example:

`ChatAnalyzer "this is a chat message"`
